MLH Local Hack Day: Build 2021 Day 2 Challenge: Build Something to Reduce Food Waste

## Task Statement
One of our favorite hacks to see built are recipe databases, smart refrigerators, and grocery list creators. We think these projects are common to see at hackathons because theyâ€™re genuinely useful for the world. Create one of these, or any other hack that works to reduce food waste, and submit your hack on our Day 2 Devpost!
